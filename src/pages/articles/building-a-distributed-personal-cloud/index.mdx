In this article, I'll be sharing my experience building [Datum](https://datum.dev) a distributed personal cloud. I'll be focusing on the design choices I made and the challenges I faced along the way. I'll also be sharing some of the lessons I learned and the tools I used.  

This series will be splitted into numerous differents parts, this is the first part of a long serie.

## What is a personal cloud?

Wikipedia definition of a personal cloud:

> A personal cloud is a collection of digital content and services which are accessible from any device. The personal cloud is not a tangible entity. It is a place which gives users the ability to store, synchronize, stream and share content on a relative core, moving from one platform, screen and location to another. Created on connected services and applications, it reflects and sets consumersâ€™ expectations for how next-generation computing services will work.[1][citation needed]
> The four primary types of personal cloud in use today are: Online cloud, NAS device cloud, server device cloud, and home-made clouds.

Datum's personal cloud definition is a bit different:

> A personal cloud is a system that allows you to use interactive and collaborative software
> with other internet peers while remaining in full control of your data. With a personal cloud
> you decide which data you expose to other peers in the cloud.


## Why you've never heard of this before? 

I'm not the first one to build a personal cloud, there are already a few projects out there. There's a few of them that have gained traction
and popularity. [Urbit](https://urbit.org) is probably the most popular one, it popularised this paradigm. 

The main reason you've never heard of such projects is complexity, most of them reinvent complete terminology and vocabulary making the entry barrier very though.
Urbit terminology sound like alien language for anyone not familiar with the internals of the project, the 0.1% of readers not getting scared of their docs might contribute to the project.

A fundamental misunderstanding all those projects have, is trying to reinvent the wheel completely. We have amazing standards, I'm thinking about TCP, UDP, QUIC, DNS, etc... Why not embracing 
all this existing knowledge everyone already has, instead of coming up with something completely different.


## What makes Datum different?

Have you heard of any of those:
- Docker
- WebAssembly
- Firecracker
- Fly.io
- AWS Lambda
- GCP Cloudrun

There's a high probability you said yes. That's because we run our software on top of those runtimes on a daily basis. All of those are runtimes that can run our software, the different between them
is how they run and in which context. Let me give you an example, **Docker** and **Cloudrun**.

> Cloudrun is the serverless hosting from Google Cloud, it takes a docker image and scale it from zero to infinity to reach your needed scale.

When you run `docker run myimage` you know that your softare will run, the same way, when you run `gcloud run deploy myservice`, you know your docker image will run in Google the same way, with the same runtime.  

Even tho it runs the same piece of software in the same runtime, you usually know that the **networking**, **filesystem** and other OS primitives might be differently configured from the local `docker run`. It's configured differently but your software can still
run correctly and make use of those primitives, there's no difference between local and cloud. As an example, you can still do an **HTTP call**, **open a socket**, **open a file**, the context is just different.


That's exactly how Datum works, it provides a runtime that executes your software within a context differently configured. Instead of using Docker, it uses WebAssembly but the analogy with Docker/Cloudrun is exactly the same.
The most popular WebAssembly runtime is [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime), between running your WebAssembly code locally with Wasmtime and Datum there's no difference.

The magic happen when your WebAssembly is executed in Datum Runtime, if you try to open a socket, Datum will automatically handle peer-to-peer resolution for you and connect you to a peer in the network.
That's the huge difference, in your code you will still do a `http.Post(addr, port, body)` but the underlying runtime resolves those differently.


I'm not gonna lie, that's not all magic, you will still need to change to programming model, but you do it with familiar terms and concepts.

## A different programming model?

You might be wondering why there's a need to change the current programming model. The reason is quite simple, with Datum you operate within a distributed peer-to-peer network.
The runtime allows you to use existing primitives like sockets or opening files, but you need to communicate with other peers on the network using peer-to-peer so the model has to be different.

Might sound scary but we provide libraries that operates on top of TCP that will make building applications on Datum much easier.


## How is it built?

Datum is a runtime, a pretty low-level runtime actually. It's built in [Zig](https://ziglang.org) to allow use to use existing C libraries and work with low-level system primitives.

In it's simplest form, Datum is a runtime to which you can feed WebAssembly binaries. The runtime **can't crash** and all executions are fully **sandboxed**.


Today's blog is an introduction to the project. We'll not dive further in the internal.


## What next?

I'm still building Datum as I write this blog post. Good progress has been made. The next part will cover Datum's p2p network implementation.
